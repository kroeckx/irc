mkpasswd.c documentation

This is documentation for the mkpasswd.c included in ircd-hybrid-7.

This version of mkpasswd can create both DES and MD5 passwords, with
either randomly generated or user provided salts.  

Options:
-m - Create an MD5 password
-d - Create a DES password
-l - Specify the length of a random MD5 salt
-p - Specify the plaintext password at the command line
-s - Specify the salt at the command line
-h - Get help

Without the presence of any parameters, it'll behave like the old mkpasswd,
creating a DES password with a randomly generated salt and prompting for
the password (without echo).

A DES salt is a pair of alphanumeric characters ('.' and '/' are permitted
as well), such as 'a4' or 'Td'.

An MD5 salt consists of up to 16 alphanumeric characters (plus '.' and '/'),
such as 'tGd' or 'J6d4dfG'.

Known bugs:
Blowfish (on OpenBSD) is not yet supported
The encryption algorithms supported depend on your system's crypt()
  implementation.
The maximum length of an MD5 salt is limited to your systems crypt()
  implementation, typically 8.

Supported Platforms (Known and tested):
Linux glibc (DES and MD5)
FreeBSD 3.x (DES (MD5 maybe))
FreeBSD 4.x (DES and MD5)
Solaris 2.5-2.6 (DES only)
Cygwin 1.1.4 (DES only)
Prior Cygwin with the MD5 libcrypt (MD5 only)
OpenBSD 2.7 (don't link with -crypt) (DES and MD5, no Blowfish support)
Mac OS-X (Darwin) (don't link with -crypt) (DES only)

Other systems probably work, but they haven't been amply tested.
