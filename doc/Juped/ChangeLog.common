	* general comments:

	various files now have dependencies depending on whether it is the
	client or server the files are being compiled for.

	* parse.c

	find_*() routines changed to use hash table lookup.

	* send.c

	changed to maximize presence of the local client array.
	sendto_ops_butone() fixed back to not broadcast wallops.

Sun Jun 30 23:21:50 1991  Armin Gruner <gruner@informatik.tu-muenchen.de>

	* parse.c
	Changed from->name to sender; Maybe double search can be removed

	* send.c
	LOOP detected!!
	Fixed sendto_channel_butone() as suggested by msa.
	send.c needs TOTAL cleanup.

	* bsd.c
	Final fixes of inet_netof() and inet_nota()

	* send.c
	Changed some SendMessage() into sendto_one() (code duplication ;))

Wed Jun 20 11:25:54 1990  Jarkko Oikarinen (jto@tolsun.oulu.fi)

	Added gruner's patches.
        Patches to make string channels work done as well to some files.

Sun Jun 17 21:29:04 1990  Armin Gruner (gruner@informatik.tu-muenchen.de)

        * parse.c
        In case that a server sends an unknown command to a client (!!),
        debug() is called, as client handles debug outputs now.

Thu May 10 17:15:12 1990  Jarkko Oikarinen (jto@tolsun.oulu.fi)

        * dbuf.c
        Fixed memcpy and bcopy problems in different machines

Sat Jan  6 15:14:14 1990  Mike Bolotski  (mikeb at coho.ee.ubc.ca)

	* config.h
	Added Poohbear's cleanup changes. 
	Added #undef SYSV if mips is defined (as per jlp@hamblin.byu.edu)


Sat Dec 16 16:06:17 1989  Mike Bolotski  (mikeb at coho.ee.ubc.ca)

	* config.h

	Changed NOTTY to TTYON, and reversed the logic everywhere.
	Now TTYON has to be explicitly defined in order to produce
	tty output.


Thu Dec 14 12:50:36 1989  Mike Bolotski  (mikeb at coho.ee.ubc.ca)

	* version.c
	Added a version.c file to contain the version numbers and
	prompt strings.  Removed the old #ifdef MAIN style definition
