        * RPL_ENDOFWHO (315) and RPL_ENDOFWHOIS (316) return
          the query parameter now as well.

	* s_msg.c
	  'Fixed' K:-line behaviour of m_user(). Now, the connection
	  is not closed; USER-msg is distributed with K:-line remark, and
	  user isn't introduced locally, so user gets 'You have not registered
	  as a user'.

	* ircd.c
	  SIGHUP generates rehash() now.

Mon Feb 11 18:57:56 1991  Armin Gruner <gruner@informatik.tu-muenchen.de>

 	* s_msg.c
	  Fixed m_server(). The domain matching was done against the
	  return value of GetClientName(), but this never matches
	  if the servername differs from the host name, because
	  [real socketname] is added to 'inpath'.

Fri Jan 12 12:34:21 1991  Jarkko Oikarinen (jto@tolsun.oulu.fi)

        * more ircd options at startup...

	  Fixes from avalon (DEBUG stuff)

Tue Nov 27 11:24:56 1990  Armin Gruner <gruner@informatik.tu-muenchen.de>

	* s_msg.c, s_bsd.c, ircd.c, class.c
	  Isolated the implementation of 'classes' to class.c (by using
	  macros for accessing the structure members) -- we should start
	  using this everywhere -- especially with this linear list of
	  clients!!

	* channel.h (new file)
	  prototyping, 'channel'-misc, try to isolate channel implemen-
	  tation to channel.h and channel.c

	  Change close() to shutdown() (restart()). 

Wed Oct 31 18:20:00 1990  Jarkko Oikarinen (jto@tolsun.oulu.fi)

	* 2.6:
	  - multichannels
	  - wildcard servers
	  - more fun stuff I don't remember anymore but which should
	    be in documentation...

Sun Oct 21 18:53:02 1990  Christopher Davis (ckd at bucsd)

        * Makefile
          - Added IRCDLIBS and IRCDMODE variables

      * s_debug.c
        New created file, common/debug.c has been moved to it because
        now we handle also debug outputs in client code

      * s_conf.c
        Added the prefix character into all reply-strings.
        MSGs never appeared on client site because parse() didn't
        recognize it as a prefix (numeric) message
        Changed the test of time-interval, now a specified interval
        that begins before midnight and ends after should also work

      * s_bsd.c
        Added setdtablesize() for sequents OS Dynix,
        default was 20; allows more socket connections.

Sat May 12 22:50:13 1990  Jarkko Oikarinen (jto@tolsun.oulu.fi)

	* s_msg.c
	  Added newline removal from the end of string ctime()
	  returns (m_info() and m_stats())

	  Added newline removal from the end of string ctime()
	  returns (m_whowas())
	* s_conf.f
	  Added close() into init_conf()
	  Was obviously forgotten from there

Thu May 10 17:17:13 1990  Jarkko Oikarinen (jto@tolsun.oulu.fi)

        * whowas.c
          Fixed memcpy and bcopy problems
