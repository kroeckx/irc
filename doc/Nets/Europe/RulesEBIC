    #####    RULES FOR ESTABLISHING NEW IRC SERVERS IN EUROPE (v1.1)   #####
    ########################################################################


	1.)	Establishing a new server and inner domain linking should be
		a local toplevel domain (country) decision.

		    Guidelines:

		    + New servers should be leafed until their admin(s) 
		      have sufficient experience to handle their server 
		      responsibly. (This avoids routing disasters).

		    + Only a link for ONE server should be given to the new
		      server site, that means the new site shouldn't be able to
		      connect test-servers to other than its own server.
		      (This avoids confusion about linking hierarchy).

		    + Be sure that if a toplevel domain hostmask link is given,
		      all hubs of that domain can connect the masked server!
		      (this should avoid disagreement between serveral hub
		      admins in one domain).


	2.)	All other links between toplevel domains (countries) should be
		dicussed between the major link coordinators of each toplevel
		domain (country). These coordinators are called European Board
		of IRC Coordinators (EBIC).

		    Guidelines:

		    + Major link coordinators of each toplevel domain (country)
		      should be published with the server sourcecode in
		      directory ./doc/Europe

                    + Each toplevel domain (country) participating in the
		      European IRC net must have a coordinator, who is
		      responsible for country-internal connections AND
		      represents the country in contacts with the rest of the
		      world. This person(s) is (are) chosen by their domain,
		      but must be approved by the EBIC.

                    + The EBIC is the only executive in charge of European 
		      interconnections and of connections from Europe to the 
		      rest of the world. They will decide linking issues
		      WITH the affected local admins.

		    + For establishing new links between several toplevel
		      domains the affected EBIC coordinators should be
		      consulted. If further coordination is needed it should
		      be discussed within the EBIC.

		    + Additional note: International links should also take
		      care of the network topology, so even if several national
		      opers agree on a same international link, they might be
		      wrong and use unecessary network ressources. The EBIC
		      should avoid such linking.

		    + Any major linking change should be announced in the
		      european mailing list:
			IRC-Operators Europe <irc-eu@grasp.insa-lyon.fr>


	3.)	Cracked servers are the concern of EBIC, overiding all local
		interests.

		    Guidelines:

		    + In a server with non-standard source code which breaks
		      the current irc protocol (especially the incorrect
		      manipulation of channel modes and user/hostname authen-
		      tication) EBIC will take action.

		    + The recommended action is permanent withdrawl of the
		      server from the IRC-net by removal from all its uplinks
		      configuration files.


	4.)	A prerequisite for getting a NEW server connection within
		Europe is an understanding of and compliance to the above
		rules.

		    Guideline:

		    + All new admins should get a copy of these rules.
