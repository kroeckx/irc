Installing IRC-
***************

   So that ircd/irc will compile and work correctly with your version
of Unix, it is necessary that you run "make" first. This will run
configure which will probe your system for any peculiarities it has and
setup the Makefile and a file of default #define's ($arch/setup.h). To
change the default directory into which ircd will install using "make
install", invoke "make" using the "CONFIGARGS=-prefix=/dir" command
line option.

The config-h file
*****************

   The second step consists of defining options before the compilation.
This is done by editing the "config.h" file and changing the various
#DEFINE's.

File: INSTALL.info,  Node: Define what type of UNIX your machine uses-,  Next: DEBUGMODE,  Up: The config-h file

Define what type of UNIX your machine uses-
===========================================

   Pick the machine type which best describes your machine and change
the #undef to #define (if needed).Some flavours of Unix require no
#define and in such cases all others should be #undef'd.


File: INSTALL.info,  Node: DEBUGMODE,  Next: SPATH CPATH MPATH LPATH PPATH TPATH,  Prev: Define what type of UNIX your machine uses-,  Up: The config-h file

DEBUGMODE
=========

   Define DEBUGMODE if you want to see the ircd debugging information
as the daemon is running. Normally this function will be undefined as
ircd produces a considerable amount of output.  DEBUGMODE must be
defined for either of -t or -x command line options to work.  Defining
this induces a large overhead for the server as it does a large amount
of self diagnostics whilst running.

   `This should only be defined for test purposes, and never used on a
production server.'


File: INSTALL.info,  Node: SPATH CPATH MPATH LPATH PPATH TPATH,  Next: CACHED_MOTD,  Prev: DEBUGMODE,  Up: The config-h file

SPATH CPATH MPATH LPATH PPATH TPATH
===================================

   Define SPATH to be the directory path to ircd.  This is usually
/usr/local/bin/ircd, unless you don't have installation permission
there.

   Define CPATH to be the directory path to the "ircd.conf" file. This
path is usually /usr/local/lib/ircd.conf. The format of this file will
be discussed later.

   The LPATH #define should be set to "/dev/null" unless you plan to
debug the program.  Note that the logfile grows very quickly.

   Define MPATH to be the path to the "motd" (message of the day) file
for the server.  Keep in mind this is automatically displayed whenever
anyone signs on to your server.

   The PPATH is optional, but if defined, should point to a file which
either doesn't exist (but is creatable) or a previously used PPATH
file.  It is used for storing the server's PID so a ps(1) isn't
necessary.

   Define TPATH to be the directory path to the "ircd.tune" file. This
path is usually /usr/local/lib/ircd.tune.  This file is used by the
server to optimize memory use.


File: INSTALL.info,  Node: CACHED_MOTD,  Next: CHROOTDIR,  Prev: SPATH CPATH MPATH LPATH PPATH TPATH,  Up: The config-h file

CACHED_MOTD
===========

   The server sends the "motd" to every client connecting.  Every time,
it reads it from the disk.  This is quite intensive and can be
undesirable for busy servers.

   Defining CACHED_MOTD will make the server store the "motd" in
memory, and only read it again from the disk when rehashing if the file
has changed.


File: INSTALL.info,  Node: CHROOTDIR,  Next: ENABLE_SUMMON ENABLE_USERS,  Prev: CACHED_MOTD,  Up: The config-h file

CHROOTDIR
=========

   To use the CHROOTDIR feature, make sure it is #define'd and that the
server is being run as root.  The server will chroot to the directory
name provded by "IRCDDIR" (in Makefile).


File: INSTALL.info,  Node: ENABLE_SUMMON ENABLE_USERS,  Next: SHOW_INVISIBLE_LUSERS NO_DEFAULT_INVISIBLE,  Prev: CHROOTDIR,  Up: The config-h file

ENABLE_SUMMON ENABLE_USERS
==========================

   For security conscious server admins, they may wish to leave
ENABLE_USERS undefined, disabling the USERS command which can be used
to glean information the same as finger can.  ENABLE_SUMMON toggles
whether the server will attempt to summon local users to irc by writing
a message similar to that from talk(1) to a user's tty.


File: INSTALL.info,  Node: SHOW_INVISIBLE_LUSERS NO_DEFAULT_INVISIBLE,  Next: OPER_KILL OPER_REHASH OPER_RESTART LOCAL_KILL_ONLY,  Prev: ENABLE_SUMMON ENABLE_USERS,  Up: The config-h file

SHOW_INVISIBLE_LUSERS NO_DEFAULT_INVISIBLE
==========================================

   On large IRC networks, the number of invisible users is likely to be
large and reporting that number cause no pain.  To aid and effect this,
SHOW_INVISIBLE_LUSERS is provided to cause the LUSERS command to report
the number of invisible users to all people and not just operators.  The
NO_DEFAULT_INVISIBLE define is used to toggle whether clients are
automatically made invisible when they register.


File: INSTALL.info,  Node: OPER_KILL OPER_REHASH OPER_RESTART LOCAL_KILL_ONLY,  Next: ZIP_LINKS ZIP_LEVEL,  Prev: SHOW_INVISIBLE_LUSERS NO_DEFAULT_INVISIBLE,  Up: The config-h file

OPER_KILL OPER_REHASH OPER_RESTART LOCAL_KILL_ONLY
==================================================

   The three operator only commands, KILL, REHASH and RESTART, may all
be disabled to ensure that an operator who does not have the correct
privilidges does not have the power to cause untoward things to occur.
To further curb the actions of guest operators, LOCAL_KILL_ONLY can be
defined to only allow locally connected clients to be KILLed.


File: INSTALL.info,  Node: ZIP_LINKS ZIP_LEVEL,  Next: SLOW_ACCEPT,  Prev: OPER_KILL OPER_REHASH OPER_RESTART LOCAL_KILL_ONLY,  Up: The config-h file

ZIP_LINKS ZIP_LEVEL
===================

   As of the 2.9.3 version of the server, server-server connections may
be compressed using the zlib.  In order to compile the server with this
feature, you MUST have the zlib package (version 1.0 or higher) already
compiled and define ZIP_LINKS in the config.h file. Compression use for
server-server connections is separately configured in the ircd.conf
file for each server-server link.  ZIP_LEVEL allows you to control the
compression level that will be used.  Values above 5 will noticeably
increase the CPU used by the server.

   The zlib package may be found at . The data format used by the zlib
library is described by RFCs (Request for Comments) 1950 to 1952 in the
files  (zlib format), rfc1951.txt (deflate format) and rfc1952.txt (gzip
format). These documents are also available in other formats from


File: INSTALL.info,  Node: SLOW_ACCEPT,  Next: CLONE_CHECK,  Prev: ZIP_LINKS ZIP_LEVEL,  Up: The config-h file

SLOW_ACCEPT
===========

   This option is defined by default and is needed on some OSes.  It
creates an artificial delay in processing incoming connections.  On a
given port, no more than 1 connection per 2 seconds will be processed.

   Undefining this will let the server process connections as fast as
it can which can cause problems on some OSes (such as SunOS) and be
abused (fast massive join of clonebots..), for these reasons, if you
decide to undefine SLOW_ACCEPT you MUST define CLONE_CHECK.


File: INSTALL.info,  Node: CLONE_CHECK,  Next: Other #define's,  Prev: SLOW_ACCEPT,  Up: The config-h file

CLONE_CHECK
===========

   This option acts as a wrapper, by checking incoming connections
early before starting ident query.  By default, the server will not
accept more than 2 connections from the same host within 10 seconds.


File: INSTALL.info,  Node: Other #define's,  Prev: CLONE_CHECK,  Up: The config-h file

Other #define's
===============

   The rest of the user changable #define's should be pretty much self
explanatory in the config.h file.  It is *NOT* recommended that any of
the file undef the line with "STOP STOP" in it be changed.


File: INSTALL.info,  Node: Editing the Makefile and compiling,  Next: The ircd-conf file,  Prev: The config-h file,  Up: Top

Editing the Makefile and compiling
**********************************

   This package now uses GNU autoconf to probe your system and generate
the correct Makefile.  However you need to edit it to specify specific
information, such as "prefix", "IRCDMODE" and "IRCDDIR".

   If GNU autoconf didn't generate a correct Makefile for your machine,
you might need to uncomment the correct "IRCDLIBS", "IRCLIBS" and
"IRCDDIR" lines.

   To now build and install the server, type "make && make install".

   If you have trouble compiling ircd, copy Makefile.in to Makefile and
edit Makefile as appropriate.

The ircd-conf file
******************

   After installing the ircd and irc programs, edit the ircd.conf file
as per the instructions in this section and install it in the location
you specified in the config.h file.  There is a sample conf file called
example.conf in the doc/ directory.

   Appendix A (See INSTALL.appendix) describes the differences between
IP addresses and host names.  If you are unfamiliar with this, you
should probably scan through it before proceeding.

   The ircd.conf file contains various records that specify
configuration options.  The record types are as follows:
  1. Server connections      (C,c,N)

  2. Machine information     (M)

  3. Client connections      (I,i)

  4. Default local server    (U)

  5. Operator priviliges     (O)

  6. Administrative info     (A)

  7. Excluded accounts       (K)

  8. Excluded machines       (Q)

  9. Connection Classes      (Y)

 10. Leaf connections        (L)

 11. Service connections     (S)

 12. Port connections        (P)

 13. Hub connections         (H)

Server connections
==================

   How to connect to other servers, How other servers can connect to you

   `WARNING:' The hostnames used as examples are really only examples
and not meant to be used (simply because they don't work) in real life.

   Now you must decide WHICH hosts you want to connect to and WHAT
ORDER you want to connect to them in.  For my example let us assume I
am on the machine "rieska.oulu.fi" and I want to connect to irc daemons
on 3 other machines:
   * "garfield.mit.edu"        - Tertiary Connection

   * "irc.nada.kth.se"         - Secondary Connection

   * "nic.funet.fi"            - Primary Connection

   And I prefer to connect to them in that order, meaning I first want
to try connecting to "nic.funet.fi", then to "irc.nada.kth.edu", and
finally to "garfield.mit.edu".  So if "nic.funet.fi" is down or
unreachable, the program will try to connect to "irc.nada.kth.se". If
irc.nada.kth.se is down it will try to connect to garfield and so forth.

   PLEASE limit the number of hosts you will attempt to connect to down
to 3. This is because of two main reasons:
  1.  to save your server from causing extra load and delays to users

  2.  to save internet from extra network traffic (remember the old
     rwho program with traffic problems when the number of machines
     increased).

`Format'
     C:<TARGET Host Addr>:<Password>:<TARGET Host NAME>:<TARGET
     PORT>:<Class>

     for example:

     C:nic.funet.fi:passwd:nic.funet.fi:6667:1

     - or -

     C:128.214.6.100:passwd:nic.funet.fi:6667:1

     - or -

     C:root@nic.funet.fi:passwd:nic.funet.fi:6667:1

     Each field is separated with a ":" charcter:

`C'
     This field tells the IRC program which option is being configured.
     "C" corresponds to a server Connect option.

`TARGET Host Addr'
     Specifies the host name or IP address of the machine to connect
     to.  If "user@" prefixes the actual hostname or IP address the
     server will require that the remote username returned by the ident
     server be the same as the one given before the "@".

`Password'
     The password of the other host.  A password must always be present
     for the line to be recognized.

`TARGET Host NAME'
     The full hostname of the target machine. This is the name that the
     TARGET server will identify itself with when you connect to it.
     If you were connecting to nic.funet.fi you would receive
     "nic.funet.fi" and that is what you should place in this field.

`TARGET PORT'
     The INTERNET Port that you want to connect to on the TARGET
     machine. Most of the time this will be set to "6667".  If this
     field is left blank, then no connections will be attempted to the
     TARGET host, and your host will accept connections FROM the TARGET
     host instead.  The port field can contain 2 ports, separated by a
     . In this case, the first port is used when auto-connecting, the
     second port is used for the UDP pings to the targer server.

`Class'
     The class field should refer to an existing class and determines
     the maximum number of simultaneous uses of the C-line allowable
     through the max. links field in the Y-line.

`NEW!!!'
     As of the 2.9.3 version of the server, server connections can be
     compressed with the zlib library.  To define a compressed
     connection, you must have compiled the server with ZIP_LINKS
     defined (cf 2.h), and use a _lowercase_ C line.

   Some examples:
   * C:nic.funet.fi::nic.funet.fi:6667:1 This reads: Connect to host
     "nic.funet.fi", with no password and expect this server to
     identify itself to you as "nic.funet.fi". Your machine will
     connect to this host to port 6667.

   * C:18.72.0.252:Jeff:garfield.mit.edu:6667:1 This reads: Connect to
     a host at address "18.72.0.252", using a password of "Jeff".  The
     TARGET server should identify itself as "garfield.mit.edu".  You
     will connect to Internet Port 6667 on this host.

   * C:irc.nada.kth.se::irc.nada.kth.se:1 This reads: do not attempt to
     connect to "irc.nada.kth.se", if "irc.nada.kth.se" requests a
     connection, allow it to connect.

   Now back to our original problem, we wanted OUR server CONNECT to 3
hosts,  "nic.funet.fi", "irc.nada.kth.se" and "garfield.mit.edu" in
that order.  So as we enter these entries into the file they must be
done in `reverse' order of how we could want to connect to them.

   Here's how it would look if we connected "nic.funet.fi" first:

   C:garfield.mit.edu::garfield.mit.edu:6667:1
C:irc.nada.kth.se::irc.nada.kth.se:6667:1
C:nic.funet.fi::nic.funet.fi:6667:1

   Ircd will attempt to connect to nic.funet.fi first, then to irc.nada
and finally to garfield.

   `Reciprocal entries:' Each "C" entry requires a corresponding "N"
entry that specifies connection priviliges to other hosts.  The "N"
entry contains the password, if any, that you require other hosts to
have before they can connect to you.  These entries are of the same
format as the "C" entries.

`Format'
     The format for the NOCONNECT entry in the "ircd.conf" is:
     N:<TARGET Host Addr>:<Password>:<TARGET Host NAME>:<Domain
     Mask>:<Class>

     Let us assume that "garfield.mit.edu" connects to your server and
     you want to place password authorization authorization on
     garfield. The "N" entry would be:

     N:garfield.mit.edu:golden:garfield.mit.edu::

     This line says: expect a connection from host "garfield.mit.edu",
     and expect a login password of "golden", and expect the host to
     identify itself as "garfield.mit.edu".

     N:18.72.0.252::garfield.mit.edu::

     This line says: expect a Connection from host "18.72.0.252", and
     don't expect login password.  The connecting host should identify
     itself as "garfield.mit.edu".

`N'
     "N" corresponds to a server Noconnect option.

`TARGET Host Addr'
     Specifies the host name or IP address of the machine to connect
     to.  If "user@" prefixes the actual hostname or IP address the
     server will require that the remote username returned by the ident
     server be the same as the one given before the "@".

`Password'
     The password of the other host.  A password must always be present
     for the line to be recognized. If CRYPT_LINK_PASSWORD is defined
     in config.h, this password must be crypted.

`TARGET Host NAME'
     The full hostname of the target machine. This is the name that the
     TARGET server will identify itself with when you connect to it.
     If you were connecting to nic.funet.fi you would receive
     "nic.funet.fi" and that is what you should place in this field.

`Domain Mask'
     Domain masking, see below.

`Class'
     The class field should refer to an existing class.

`Wildcards domains'
     To reduce the great amount of servers in IRCnet wildcard DOMAINS
     were introduced in 2.6. To explain the usage of wildcard domains
     we take an example of such:

     *.de  - a domain name matching all machines in Germany.

     Wildcard domains are useful in that ALL SERVERS in Germany (or any
     other domain area) can be shown as one to the rest of the world.
     Imagine 100 servers in Germany, it would be incredible waste of
     netwotk bandwidth to broadcast all of them to all servers around
     the world.

     So wildcard domains are a great help, but how to use them ?

     They can be defined in the N-line for a given connection, in place
     of "Domain Mask" you write a magic number called wildcard count.

     Wildcard count tells you HOW MANY PARTS of your server's name
     should be replaced by a wildcard. For example, your server's name
     is "tolsun.oulu.fi" and you want to represent it as "*.oulu.fi" to
     "nic.funet.fi". In this case the wildcard count is 1, because only
     one word (tolsun) is replaced by a wildcard.

     If the wildcard count would be 2, then the wildcard domain would
     be "*.fi". Note that with wildcard name "*.fi" you could NOT
     connect to "nic.funet.fi" because that would result in a server
     name `collision' (*.fi matches nic.funet.fi).

     I advice you to not to use wildcard servers before you know for
     sure how they are used, they are mostly beneficial for backbones
     of countries and other large areas with common domain.

Machine information
===================

`Introduction'
     IRC needs to know a few things about your UNIX site, and the "M"
     command specifies this information for IRC.  The fomat of this
     command is:

`Format'
     M:<Server NAME>:<YOUR Internet IP#>:<Geographic Location>:<Port>

`M'
     "M" specifies a Machine description line

`Server NAME'
     The name of YOUR server adding any Internet DOMAINNAME that might
     also be present. If this hostname can be resolved, the IP# found
     will be used to for outgoing connections.  Otherwise the default
     interface address of the host is used.  The server name may not be
     FQDN of another host.  (This means all outgoing connections will
     be done from the same IP#, even if your host has several IP#).

`YOUR Internet IP#'
     If the machine on which you run the server has several IP
     addresses, you can define which IP# to use for outgoing
     connections.  This overrides overrides the "Server NAME".

     See Also the "Port Connections" section.

`Geographic Location'
     Geographic Location is used to say WHERE YOUR SERVER is, and gives
     people in other parts of the world a good idea of where you are!
     If your server is in the USA, it is usually best to say: <CITY>
     <STATE>, USA.  Like for Denver I say: "Denver Colorado, USA".
     Finnish sites (like tolsun.oulu.fi generally say something like
     "Oulu, Finland".

`Port'
     Defines the port on which your server will listen for UDP pings
     from other servers.  This should be the port were other servers
     are set to autoconnect.  (Also see the port field description in
     connect lines).

`Example:'
     M:tolsun.oulu.fi::Oulu, Finland:6667:

     This line reads: My Host's name is "tolsun.oulu.fi" and my site is
     located in "Oulu, Finland".

     M:orion.cair.du.edu::Denver Colorado, USA:6667:

     This line reads: My Hosts name is "orion.cair.du.edu" and my site
     is located in "Denver Colorado, USA".

Client connections
==================

   How to let clients connect to your IRCD.
`Introduction'
     A client is a program that connects to the ircd daemon (ircd).
     There are clients written in C, GNU Emacs Lisp and many other
     languages.  The "irc" program is the C client.  Each person that
     talks via IRC is running their own client.

     The ircd.conf files contains entries that specify which clients
     are allowed to connect to your irc daemon.  Obviously you want to
     allow your own machine's clients to connect.  You may want to
     allow clients from other sites to connect.  These remote clients
     will use your server as a connection point.  All messages sent by
     these clients will pass through your machine.

`Format'
     I:<TARGET Host Addr>:<Password>:<TARGET Hosts NAME>:<Port>:<Class>
     i:<TARGET Host Addr>:<Password>:<TARGET Hosts NAME>:<Port>:<Class>

`Examples'
     For example, if you were installing IRC on tolsun.oulu.fi and you
     wanted to allow examples sake let us assume you were making this
     file for tolsun and you wanted to let your own clients to connect
     to your server, you would add this entry to the file:

     I:x::tolsun.oulu.fi::1

     If you wanted to let remote clients connect, you could add the
     following lines:

     I:x::*.du.edu::1

     Allow any clients from machines whose names end in "du.edu" to
     connect with no password.

     I:128.214.6.100::nic.funet.fi::1

     Allow clients from a machine with that IP number to connect.
     Numeric match is enough, name is not required anymore.

     I:x:secret:*.tut.fi::1

     Allow clients from machines matching *.tut.fi to connect with the
     password "secret".

     I:*::*::1

     Allow anyone from anywhere to connect your server.

     This is the easiest way, but it also allows people to for example
     dump files to your server, or connect 1000 (or how many open
     sockets per process your OS allows) clients to your machine and
     take your network ports. Of course the same things can be done by
     simply telnetting to your machine's SMTP port (for example).

     I:x::*.fi:6667:1

     Allow clients from machines matching *.fi to connect on the port
     6667.

     I:*@*::*@*::1

     Allow clients from anywhere to connect your server. If the client
     machine does not reply to your server ident query, the client's
     username will be prefixed by ~

`NEW!!!'
     As of the 2.7.2d version of the server, the server is able to
     accept connections on multiple ports. I-lines are required for
     each P-line to allow connections to be accepted. For unix sockets,
     this means either adding I:/path/port::/path/port or some variation
     (wildcards are recognised here). For internet ports, there must be
     an I-line which allows the host access as normal, but the port
     field of the I-line must match that of the port of the socket
     accepting the connectiion. A port number of 0 is a wildcard
     (matches all ports).

`NEW!!!'
     As of the 2.9.1 version of the server, i lines are introduced.
     They work the same way as I lines, but the clients matching an i
     line will have a restricted connection. (no nick/mode change, no
     kick). Such users will have their username prefixed by +, = or -
     depending on the ident reply.

Default local server (for local clients) `*OBSOLETED*'
======================================================

`Introduction'
     This defines the default connection for the irc client.  If you
     are running an ircd server on the same machine, you will want to
     define this command to connect to your own host.  If your site is
     not running a server then this command should contain the TARGET
     host's connection information and password (if any).

`Format'
     U:<TARGET Host addr>:<Password>:<TARGET Host NAME>:<Internet Port>

`Examples'
     U:tolsun.oulu.fi::tolsun.oulu.fi:6667
     U:128.214.5.6::tolsun.oulu.fi:6667 U:tolsun.oulu.fi::tolsun.oulu.fi

     If the port number is omitted, irc will default to using 6667.

Operator priviliges
===================

   How to become the IRC administrator on your site
`Introduction'
     To become an IRC Administrator, IRC must know who is authorized to
     become an operator and what their "Nickname" and "Password" is.

`Format'
     O:<TARGET Host NAME>:<Password>:<Nickname>:<Port>:<Class>

`O'
     Speficies Operator record. If you use capital letter ("O") in it,
     it specifies a global operator. Small letter ("o") specifies a
     local operator. Local operator has basically the same rights
     except global operator with some restrictions.

`TARGET Host NAME'
     Tells IRC which host you have the privileges FROM.  This means
     that you should be logged into this host when you ask for the
     priviliges.  If you specify "tolsun.oulu.fi" then IRC will expect
     your CLIENT to be connected at "tolsun.oulu.fi" - when you ask for
     OPERATOR privileges from "tolsun.oulu.fi".  You cannot be logged in
     at any other host and be able to use your OPERATOR privileges at
     tolsun, only when you are connected at TOLSUN will this work -
     this is a safeguard against unauthorized sites.

`Password'
     If your AUTHORIZATION Password - this is the password that let's
     IRC know you are who you say you are!  Never tell anyone your
     password and always keep the "ircd.conf" file protected from all
     of the other users.

`Nickname'
     The Nickname you usually go by - but you can make this what you
     want.

`Port'
     Unused.

`Class'
     The class field should refer to an existing class (preferably
     having a lower number than that for the relevant I-line) and
     determines the maximum number of simultaneous uses of the O-line
     allowable through the max. links field in the Y-line.

`Example'
     O:orion.cair.du.edu:pyunxc:Jeff::1

     There is an OPERATOR at "orion.cair.du.edu" that can get Operator
     priviliges if he specifies a password of "pyunxc" and uses a
     NICKNAME of "Jeff".

Administrative info
===================

`Introduction'
     The "A" line is used for administrative information about a site.
     The e-mail address of the person running the server should be
     included here in case problems arise.

`Format'
     A:<Your Name/Location>:<Your Electronic Mailing Addr>:<other>::

`A'
     This specifies an Admin record.

`Your Name & Location'
     Use this field to say tell your FULL NAME and where in the world
     your machine is.  Be sure to add your City, State/Province and
     Country.

`Your Electronix Mailing Addr'
     Use this field to specify your Electronic Mailing Address
     preferably your Internet Mailing Address.  If you have a UUCP or
     ARAPnet address - please add that as well.  Be sure to add any
     extra DOMAIN information that is needed, for example "mail
     jtrim@orion" probably won't work as a mail address to me if you
     happen to be in Alaska.  But "mail jtrim@orion.cair.du.edu" would
     work because you know that "orion" is part of the DOMAIN
     "cair.du.edu".  So be sure to add your DOMAINNAMES to your mailing
     addresses.

`Other'
     This is really an OTHER field - you can add what you want here.

`Example'
     (the line is just one line in the confuration file, here it is cut
     into two lines to make it clearer to read):

     A:Jeff Trim -  Denver Colorado, USA:INET jtrim@orion.cair.du.edu
     UUCP {hao,isis}!udenva!jtrim:Terve! Heippa!  Have you said hello
     in Finnish today?;)::

     Would look like this when printed out with the /admin command:

     Jeff Trim -  Denver Colorado, USA INET jtrim@orion.cair.du.edu
     UUCP {hao,isis}!udenva!jtrim Terve! Hei! Heippa!  Have you said
     hello in Finnish today? ;)

     Note that the A record cannot be split across multiple lines; it
     will typically be longer than 80 characters and will therefore
     wrap around the screen.

Excluded accounts
=================

   Remove an errant user from IRC on your site.
`Introduction'
     Obviously it is hoped that you wouldn't have to use this command.
     Unfortunately sometimes a user can become unmanageable and this is
     your only recourse - the KILL USER command.  THIS COMMAND ONLY
     AFFECTS YOUR SERVER - If this user can connect to another SERVER
     somewhere else in the IRC-Network then you would have to talk to
     the administrator on that site to disable his access from that
     IRCD Server as well.

`Format'
     K:<Host Name>:<time interval(s)|comment>:<User>:<port>:

`K'
     "K" tells the IRCD that you are making a KILL USER command entry.

`Host Name'
     In this field you specify the Hostname that the user is connecting
     from.  If you wanted to REMOVE connects to IRC from
     "orion.cair.du.edu" then you would want to enter
     "orion.cair.du.edu".  If you want to REMOVE ALL HOSTS access you
     can use "*" (Wild Card notation) and no matter what host the
     USERNAME (specified in Field 4) connects from s/he will be denied
     access. Removing all hosts isn't very smart thing to do though,
     why would you run an ircd if you allow nobody to connect to it
     anyways ?

`time interval(s)|comment'
     Either leave this field empty or put a comment, then the line
     active continuously for the specified user/host machine.  You may
     also specify intervals during the line should be active, see
     examples below.

`User'
     The USERNAME of the user you want removed from IRC.  For example
     "root".

`Port'
     The port on which the Kill line will be effective. 0 means all
     ports.

`Examples'
     K:orion.cair.du.edu::jtrim:0:

     If user "jtrim" connects to IRC from host "orion.cair.du.edu" then
     IMMEDIATELY REMOVE HIM from my IRCD.

     K:*.cair.du.edu::root:0:

     If user "root" connects to IRC from any host that has the suffix
     "cair.du.edu" - then IMMEDIATELY REMOVE THEM from my IRCD.

     K:*::vijay:0:

     This line reads "I don't care WHAT HOST user "vijay" is on, I will
     NEVER allow username "vijay" to login to my IRCD."

     K:*.oulu.fi:0800-1200,1400-1900:*:0:

     This disallows all users from hosts with enddomain "oulu.fi"
     access to your server between 8 and 12am, 2 and 7pm. Users get
     kicked off if they're already signed on when the line becomes
     active (they'll get a warning 5 minutes ago).

=================

   Disallowing SERVERS in your irc net.
`Introduction'
     In some cases people run into difficulties in net administration.
     For one reason or another you do not want a certain server to be
     in your net (for example because of the security holes it opens for
     every server if it's not secured carefully). In that case you
     should use Q-lines in your server. When you specify a server name
     in Q-line, everytime some server link tries to introduce you a
     server (remember, all server names are broadcast around the net),
     that name is checked if it matches the Q-lines in your server. If
     it matches, then `your server' disconnects the link. Note that just
     placing Q-lines to your server probably results in `your server'
     being left alone, unless other servers have agreed to have the
     same Q-line in their ircd configuration files as well.

`Example'
     Q::of the security holes:foo.bar.baz::

     This command excludes a server named "foo.bar.baz", the reason is
     given to be security holes (you should give a reason, it is
     polite). The first field is unused, so leave it empty.


File: INSTALL.info,  Node: Connection Classes,  Next: Leaf connections,  Prev: Excluded machines,  Up: The ircd-conf file

Connection Classes
==================

`Introduction'
     To enable more efficient use of MAXIMUM_LINKS, connection classes
     were implemented.  To give a connection a class, add another field
     (a sixth) to the C/N lines for a particular server.  Each line for
     a server should have the same number as the sixth field.  If it is
     absent, the server deaults it to 0, using the defaults from the
     config.h file.  To define a connection class, you need to include
     a Y: line in the ircd.conf file.  This enables you to define the
     ping frequency, connection frequency and maximum number of links
     that class should have.  Currently, the Y: line MUST appear in the
     ircd.conf file BEFORE it is used in any other way.

`Format'
     Y:<Class>:<Ping Frequency>:<Connect freq|Max IP>:<Max
     Links>:<Sendq>

`Y'
     This is the class number which gains the following attributes and
     should match that which is on the end of the C/N/I/O line.

`Class'
     This field defines how long the server will let the connection
     remain "silent" before sending a PING message to make sure it is
     still alive.  Unless you are sure of what you are doing, use the
     default value which is in your config.h file.

`Ping Frequency'
     This field has a different meaning depending on the use of the Y
     line:
        * For servers: By changing this number, you change how often
          your server checks to see if it can connect to this server.
          If you want to check very occasionally, use a large value,
          but if it is an important connection, you might want a
          smaller value so that you connect to it as soon as possible.

        * For clients:
             *  Positive value: defines the maximum number of clients
               from the same host (IP) will be allowed.

             *  Negative value: defines the maximum number of clients
               from the same user@host (IP) will be allowed.  Read note
               below.

`Max Links'
     This field defines the maximum number of links this class will
     allow from automatic connections (C lines).  Using /CONNECT
     overrides this feature.  Also defines the maximum number of users
     in this class (I/O lines).

`Sendq'
     This field defines the "sendq" value for this class.  If thisfield
     is not present, the default (from config.h) is assigned.

`Note'
     leaving any of the fields out means their value is 0 (ZERO)!!

`Note'
     If you plan to use the user@host limit, please read the following
     very carefully.  The "user" value is the ident reply for the
     connection.  If no reply was given then it defaults to "unknown"
     and thus the effective limit will be per host, not per user@host.
     Also, some ident servers return encrypted data which changes for
     every connection making the limit void.

`Example'
     Y:23:120:300:5:

     This defines class 23 to allow 5 auto-connections, which are
     checked every 300 seconds.  The connection is allowed to remain
     silent for 120 seconds before a PING is sent.  NOTE: fields 3 & 4
     are in seconds.

     You may also give I lines a class (again the sixth field to define
     which class).  This is only usefull (currently) for redefining the
     ping frequency.  It can also be useful as a diagnostic to see how
     much each I line is used when combined with the TRACE output.

     Another feature of connection class is the ability to do automatic
     routing by using the class as a "priority".  If you are connected
     to a server which has a class lower than one of the servers that
     is "behind" it, the server will disconnect the lower class one and
     schedule a "new" connection for the higher class server.

Leaf connections
================

`Introduction'
     To stop servers which should only act as leaves from hubs becoming
     hubs accidently, the L line was introduced so that hubs can be
     aware of which servers should and shouldnt be treated as leaves. A
     leaf server is supposed to remain a node for the entirity of its
     life whilst connected to the IRC server network.  It is quite easy,
     however for a leaf server to be incorrectly setup and create
     problems by becoming a node of 2 or more servers, ending its life
     as a leaf. The L line enables the administrator of an IRC "Hub
     server" to "stop" a server which is meant to act as a leaf trying
     to make itself a hub.  If, for example, the leaf server connects
     to another server which doesnt have an L-line for it, the one
     which does will drop the connection, once again making the server
     a leaf.

`Format'
     L:<Server Mask>:*:<Server Name>:<Max Depth>:

`Server Mask'
     Mask of which servers the leaf-like attributes are used on when
     the server receives SERVER messages.  The wildcards * and ? may be
     used within this field for matching purposes.  If this field is
     empty, it acts the same as if it were a single * (ie matches
     everything).

`Server Name'
     The name of the server connected to you that for which you want to
     enforce leaf-like attributes upon.

`Max Depth'
     Maximum depth allowed on that leaf and if not specified, a value
     of 1 is assumed.  The depth is checked each time a SERVER message
     is received by the server, the hops to the server being the field
     checked against this max depth and if greater, the connection to
     the server that made its leaf too deep has its connection dropped.
     For the L-line to come into effect, both fields, 2 and 4, must
     match up with the new server being introduced and the server which
     is responsible for introducing this new server.

Service connections (Not Fully Implemented Yet)
===============================================

`Introduction'
     The Service is a special kind of IRC client. It does not have the
     full abilities of a normal user but can behave in a more active
     manner than a normal client.

`Format'
     S:<TARGET Host Mask>:<Password>:<Service Name>:<Service
     Type>:<Class>

`TARGET Host Mask'
     The host mask should be set to match the host(s) from which the
     service will be connecting from. This may be either an IP# or full
     name (prefered).

`Password'
     This is the password which must be passed in the SERVICE command.

`Service Name'
     : The name used by the service. Services don't have nicknames, but
     a static name defined by the S line.

`Service Type'
     The type of service. It defines the priviledges given to the
     service. Be very careful in the types you allow.  The types can be
     found in include/service.h

`Class'
     The class field should refer to an existing class.

`Notes'
     To connect a service to your server, you must first create an
     S-line entry in your ircd.conf file and get your server to read
     this in (ie rehash or reboot). Once your server has updated
     itself, you can then attempt to register your connection as a
     service.  Registering as a service is done by sending a SERVICE
     command to the server:

     SERVICE servicename servername distribution servicetype 0
     :Information

     A successfull registering of a service at the server will result
     in a RPL_YOURESERVICE (383) being sent back to you. Any other
     reply as a result of sending service indicates an error has
     occured.

     A service is not a very useful sort of client, it cannot join
     channels or issue certain commands although most are available to
     it. Services are rejected upon sending an unknown or unallowed
     command. Services however, are not affected by flood control and
     can be granted special priviledges. It is therefore wise to
     oversee the use of S-lines with much care.

     Services can be listed using the SERVLIST command, and can be sent
     messages using the SQUERY command.

Port connections
================

`Introduction'
     The port line adds flexibility to the server's ability to accept
     connections. By use of this line in the ircd.conf file, it is easy
     to setup both Unix Domain ports for the server to accept
     connections on as well as extra internet ports.

`Format'
     P:<Internet IP#>:<*>:<Internet IP Mask>:<Port>:
     P:<Directory>:<*>:<*>:<Port>:

   * Internet Ports
    `Internet IP#'
          If the host on which the server runs has several IP
          addresses, you can define for which IP address connections
          will be accepted. If no is defined here, server will bind to
          all interfaces (INADDR_ANY).  See also MACHINE CONFIGURATION
          section to properly configure outgoing connections.

          P:192.168.1.194:::6664:

    `Internet IP# Mask'
          This defines where connections may come from and be accepted.
          The IP mask uses either *'s or 0's as wildcards. The
          following two lines are the same:

          P:::128.2.*:6664: P:::128.2.0.0:6664:

          The incoming isn't matched against the mask, rather the ip#
          string is decoded and compared segment by segment. Thus

          P:128.2*.1.2:::6664:

          will not match 128.20.1.2.

    `Port'
          The port number field tells the server which port number it
          should listen on for incoming connections.

   *  Unix Socket Ports.
    `Directory'
          The path set in this field should be the directory name in
          which to create the unix socket for later listening to. The
          server will attempt to create the directory before creating
          the unix socket.

    `Port'
          The port field when used in combination with a pathname in a
          P-line is the filename created in the directory set in the
          first field.

    `Example'
          P:/tmp/.ircd:::6667:

          Creates a unix socket in the /tmp/.ircd directory called
          "6667". The unix socket (file) must be a numerical.

`Note'
     You need at least one P line.

Hub connections
===============

`Introduction'
     In direct contrast to L-lines, the server also implements H-lines
     to determine which servers may act as a hub and what they may "hub
     for".  If a server is only going to supply its own name (ie act as
     a solitary leaf) then no H-line is required for, else a H-line
     must be added.

`Format'
     H:<Server Mask>:*:<Server Name>::

`Server Mask'
     All servers that are allowed via this H-line must match the mask
     given in this field.

`Server Name'
     This field is used to match exactly against a server name,
     wildcards being treated as literal characters.

`Examples'
     H:*.edu::*.bu.edu::

     Allows a server named "*.bu.edu" to introduce only servers that
     match the "*.edu" name mask.

     H:*::eff.org::

     Allows "eff.org" to introduce (and act as a hub for) any server.

`Note'
     It is possible to have and use multiple H-lines (or L-lines) for
     the one server.  eg:

     H:*.edu:*:*.bu.edu:: H:*.au:*:*.bu.edu::

     is allowed as is

     L:*.edu:*:*.au:: L:*.com:*:*.au::


File: INSTALL.info,  Node: Version limitations,  Prev: Hub connections,  Up: The ircd-conf file

Version limitations
===================

`Introduction'
     V-lines are used to restrict server connecting to you based on
     their version and on compile time options.

`Format'
     V:<Version Mask>:<Flags>:<Server Mask>::

`Version Mask'
     The matching version strings will be rejected.

`Flags'
     This field should contained flags as defined in ircd/s_debug.c

     These flags show up in RPL_VERSION.

     If any of the flags present in this field are found in the
     RPL_VERSION of a server, this server will be denied connection.
     This must be used with care.

`Server Mask'
     This field is used to match server names.  The V line will be used
     for servers matching the mask given in this field.

`Examples'
     V:020901*::*::

     Disallows any server which version is 2.9.1* to connect.

     V:020901*:D:*::

     Disallows any server which version is 2.9.1* or which has been
     compiled with DEBUGMODE defined to connect.

`Note'
     It is possible to have and use multiple V-lines for the one server
     mask.

     V:020901:*:*:: V:020902:*:*::

     is allowed.
