Most important changes in 2.11 server grouped by who most benefits from the
feature or who should look at it more carefully.

All:
	* Nicknames cannot contain [|]{\} chars. (This restriction will be
	  removed in 2.11.1)
	* Channel names cannot contain {\}~ chars. If used (or from remote),
	  they will be changed to [|]^ accordingly. (This restriction will be
	  removed in 2.11.1)
	* New channel list type: R (aka reop hints). With the same syntax and
	  behaviour as beI, it serves as a hint list for reopping opless
	  channels.
	* Clients cannot set +R. (This restriction will be removed in 2.11.1)
	* CIDR support in +beIR channelmodes.
	* +beIR channelmodes have new wildcard `#' matching any digit; note
	  that if ban starts with digit, it will match on UID, if with '#',
	  it will match on nickname.
	* New stats k to show tklines (stats K shows klines).

Client:
	* When collision occurs, clients get their nicks forcefully changed
	  to their UIDs. (Note: this requires no 2.10 server on the path
	  between these two clients!)
	* Clients can use "NICK 0" to get their UID as a nick. Works during
	  registration, too.
	* Channels now keep information who and when set the topic.
	* LIST (if allowed) does not disconnect if client's sendQ fills.
	* WHOIS now shows the time user signed on.
	* LUSERS (and USERS, if defined) shows local and global usercount and
	  maximums.
	* INVITE overriding ban shows inviter's n!u@h in channel notice.
	* Support for text representation of user modes in USER command
	  during registration.

Operator:
	* New server to server protocol, based on Unique IDs
	* Operator broadcast message syntax has been changed to:
		$$*.mask - message all users matching given server mask
		$#*.mask - message all users matching given hostname mask
	* Essential notices were moved from &LOCAL to &NOTICES
	* Possibility of using port "0" in manual CONNECTs (even remote);
	  ircd will use port from ircd.conf
	* Added DelayedKill feature to make ircd more responsible on rehash
	  on big servers with many clients and many klines.
	* New server channel &CLIENTS with clients connects, quits and nick
	  changes (may be undefined during compilation).
	* New command: TKLINE (syntax: TKLINE seconds user@host :reason),
	  available for services and (depending on O: flag) opers.

Admin:
	* File layout changed slightly:
	  - localstatedir defaults to $(prefix)/var (autoconf did that!)
	  - logdir defaults to $(localstatedir)/log, not $(prefix)/var/log
	  - ircd_var_dir (where .pid and .tune are kept) defaults to
	    $(localstatedir)/run
	  - log files are no longer in $(prefix)/var/log/ircd/, instead
	    they are in $(logdir)
	  - log file names changed from $(logdir)/{users,rejects,auth}
	    to $(logdir)/ircd.{users,rejects,auth}
	  - config and log file names depend on $(IRCD) name.
	* Ability to specify outgoing IP in C: line.
	* I:line now requires both addr and name fields to match.
	* I:line flags
		D - restricted, when client has no reverse DNS.
		E - client is exempted from K: lines.
		e - client is exempted from X: lines.
		F - fall-through to next I: if password did not match.
		I - restricted, when client has no ident.
		N - disable resolved hostname to be used.
		M - disable resolved hostname to be shown.
		R - restricted.
	* Reject reason sent to client can be specified in iauth.conf.
	* Client's username and hostname are checked for valid chars.
	* C:lines can have negative ports to disable autoconnects; these
	  will be used when CONNECT with port "0" is used.
	* STATS ? shows quick information about connected servers.
	* STATS f, avaible to local operators only, shows detailed
	  information about client TCP connection.
	* -t option (foreground mode) is now avaible even without DEBUGMODE
	* Added SET command which makes possible to fine-tune certain
	  ircd values during runtime (like dbuf poolsize, autoconnect and client
	  accepting).
	* Stats Z no longer computes real memory statistics unless DEBUGMODE
	  set.
	* Stats l/L shows count in Bytes, not kBytes.
	* SERVICE command changed, it uses SID now.
	* O:line flags for better control
		L - local operator (disables all remote functions)
		P - removes penalty
		p - allows flooding
		& - allows joining &CLIENTS
		A - enables all flags below
		K - allows KILL (local and remote)
		k - allows only local KILL
		S - allows SQUIT (local and remote)
		s - allows only local SQUIT
		C - allows CONNECT (local and remote)
		c - allows only local CONNECT
		l - allows CLOSE
		h - allows HAZH
		d - allows DNS
		r - allows REHASH
		R - allows RESTART
		D - allows DIE
		e - allows SET
		T - allows TKLINE
		t - enables full TRACE and STATS L
	* New config X-line.
	* New module to iauth: mod_webproxy.
	* socks and webproxy modules can connect to different ports.
	* "delayed" execution mode for iauth.
	* P:line flags.
