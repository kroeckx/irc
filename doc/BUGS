The list is probably not as scary as it once was.
Anyone with some free time is welcome to fix those =)

* The server still occasionnally crashes because of some bug
  in the hash tables. (Vesa already fixed this bug several
  times but it keeps crashing :^) [We haven't seen this one
  in ages.]

* RECONNECT is still in some unknown state. (and deactivated
  for various reasons)
