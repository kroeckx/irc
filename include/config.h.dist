 * secondary with C:blah::blah:6667 lines. THEY SHOULD NOT TRY TO

 * do a similar thing. Put the American nodes you want to connect to
 * in with C:blah::blah:6667 lines, and the Australian nodes with
 * C:blah::blah lines. Have the Americans put you in with C:blah::blah
 * lines. Then you will only connect to one of the Americans.
